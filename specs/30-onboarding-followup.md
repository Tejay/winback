# Spec 30 — Onboarding follow-up + dormant-account cleanup

**Phase:** Pre-launch growth + hygiene
**Depends on:** Spec 25 (admin role / `wb_users.is_admin`), existing
`/api/cron/reengagement` infrastructure, Resend founder-email pattern
**Estimated time:** ~5 hours

---

## Context

A founder registers via `POST /api/auth/register`. We create a
`wb_users` row + a blank `wb_customers` row, then redirect them to
`/onboarding/stripe`. If they never click **Connect Stripe**,
`wb_customers.stripe_account_id` and `stripe_access_token` stay NULL
**indefinitely**. Today there is **no follow-up** — these accounts:

- Receive **no nudge email** to come back
- Are **invisible** in `/admin/customers` (no filter for them)
- Don't show up in any **funnel analytics** (we log
  `onboarding_stripe_viewed` and `oauth_completed`, but not
  `register_completed` — so funnel drop-off can't be reconstructed cleanly)
- Are **kept forever**, even though they hold a verified email + a
  legal-acceptance record (Spec 11 GDPR debt)

This spec ships the minimum-viable treatment for that cohort.

---

## Goals

| # | Goal | Mechanism |
|---|------|-----------|
| 1 | Recover the founders who got distracted, with one polite nudge | Day-3 transactional email via Resend, fired by daily cron |
| 2 | Warn dormant accounts before deletion (courtesy + GDPR posture) | Day-83 deletion-warning email — last chance to keep the account alive |
| 3 | Give the operator visibility for high-value manual outreach | New `/admin/customers?filter=stuck_on_signup` filter + "Days since signup" column |
| 4 | Make the funnel analytically complete | Emit `register_completed` event in the registration handler |
| 5 | Prune accounts that never connect within 90 days | Cascade-delete `wb_users` row on day 90; data minimisation aligns with future Spec 11 |

---

## Non-goals

- Multi-touch drip campaigns. The nudge at Day 3 and warning at Day 83
  are the only two emails. The Day-83 message is functional/transactional
  ("we're going to delete your account in 7 days") not promotional.
- Tracking `last_login_at`. We deliberately don't add this column. The
  90-day clock is from `wb_customers.created_at`, period. If the founder
  is logging in but never connecting Stripe, the in-app redirect is
  doing its job — they have a clear next step every time.
- Sending emails for accounts created before Spec 30 lands. The cron
  query naturally excludes them from the nudge pass once
  `onboarding_nudge_sent_at` is non-null, but the prune pass *will* sweep
  pre-existing dormant accounts on its first run. **Mitigation: first
  prod cron run uses `?dryRun=1` for human review of the eligible set.**

---

## Detection (single SQL truth)

```sql
-- "Stuck on signup" cohort
SELECT u.id, u.email, c.id AS customer_id, c.created_at, c.onboarding_nudge_sent_at
FROM   wb_users u
JOIN   wb_customers c ON c.user_id = u.id
WHERE  c.stripe_account_id IS NULL
  AND  u.is_admin = false;

-- Eligible for nudge: 3 ≤ days_old < 90 AND not already nudged
-- Eligible for prune: days_old ≥ 90 AND no recoveries
```

---

## Database — migration 025

```sql
ALTER TABLE wb_customers
  ADD COLUMN onboarding_nudge_sent_at         TIMESTAMP,
  ADD COLUMN deletion_warning_sent_at         TIMESTAMP;

-- Partial index — only the eligible nudge cohort.
CREATE INDEX wb_customers_onboarding_nudge_idx
  ON wb_customers (created_at)
  WHERE stripe_account_id IS NULL AND onboarding_nudge_sent_at IS NULL;
```

Drizzle: add to the `customers` pgTable in [lib/schema.ts](../lib/schema.ts):
```ts
onboardingNudgeSentAt:    timestamp('onboarding_nudge_sent_at'),
deletionWarningSentAt:    timestamp('deletion_warning_sent_at'),
```

**Why a column instead of querying `wb_events` for the audit?** `logEvent`
swallows insert errors (it's telemetry, not transactional). A dedicated
column gives us a transactional guarantee in the same UPDATE that follows
the email send, plus a cheap indexable timestamp the cron can put in its
WHERE clause.

---

## Cron route

`app/api/cron/onboarding-followup/route.ts`. Mirror
[reengagement/route.ts](../app/api/cron/reengagement/route.ts):

- `export const maxDuration = 60`
- Same `Bearer ${process.env.CRON_SECRET}` auth check
- Default `nodejs` runtime
- Accepts `?dryRun=1` query param (skip sends + skip deletes, log counts only)

**Why a separate cron, not folded into `/api/cron/reengagement`?**
Different concern (founder lifecycle vs. subscriber win-back), different
audit posture (the prune pass touches `wb_users`), different rollback story.
Mixing them muddies the single-responsibility line drawn in Spec 28.

Schedule (`vercel.json`): `30 9 * * *` — offset by 30 min from the existing
09:00 UTC reengagement cron so logs interleave cleanly.

The route delegates to three helpers in
`src/winback/lib/onboarding-followup.ts` so the passes are unit-testable
in isolation:

- `runOnboardingNudges({ dryRun }): Promise<{ processed, sent, errors }>`
- `runDeletionWarnings({ dryRun }): Promise<{ processed, sent, errors }>`
- `runStaleAccountPrune({ dryRun }): Promise<{ processed, deleted, errors }>`

Response:
```json
{
  "nudges":   { "processed": N, "sent": M, "errors": E },
  "warnings": { "processed": N, "sent": M, "errors": E },
  "deletes":  { "processed": N, "deleted": M, "errors": E },
  "dryRun":   false
}
```

### Pass A — nudge (Day ≥ 3, < 90)

Eligibility:

```ts
where(and(
  isNull(customers.stripeAccountId),
  isNull(customers.onboardingNudgeSentAt),
  eq(users.isAdmin, false),
  sql`${customers.createdAt} <= now() - interval '3 days'`,
  sql`${customers.createdAt} >  now() - interval '90 days'`,
)).limit(100)
```

Per-row sequence:

1. **Re-check** `stripeAccountId IS NULL` inside the loop (race: they may
   have connected between bulk-select and now)
2. `sendOnboardingNudgeEmail({ to: users.email, founderName: customers.founderName })`
3. `UPDATE wb_customers SET onboarding_nudge_sent_at = now() WHERE id = ?`
   — written **after** the send (matches reengagement precedent; one
   duplicate nudge on a transient Resend failure is acceptable)
4. `logEvent({ name: 'onboarding_nudge_sent', customerId, userId })`

Errors caught per-row, counter incremented, loop continues.

### Pass B — deletion warning (Day ≥ 83, < 90)

Eligibility:

```ts
where(and(
  isNull(customers.stripeAccountId),
  isNull(customers.deletionWarningSentAt),
  eq(users.isAdmin, false),
  sql`${customers.createdAt} <= now() - interval '83 days'`,
  sql`${customers.createdAt} >  now() - interval '90 days'`,
)).limit(100)
```

Per-row sequence: same shape as Pass A.
1. Re-check `stripeAccountId IS NULL`
2. `sendDormantAccountDeletionWarningEmail({ to, founderName })`
3. `UPDATE wb_customers SET deletion_warning_sent_at = now() WHERE id = ?`
4. `logEvent({ name: 'onboarding_deletion_warning_sent', customerId, userId })`

### Pass C — cascade prune (Day ≥ 90)

Eligibility:

```ts
where(and(
  isNull(customers.stripeAccountId),
  eq(users.isAdmin, false),
  sql`${customers.createdAt} <= now() - interval '90 days'`,
  // Defensive: never prune a customer that somehow has recoveries
  sql`NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM wb_recoveries r WHERE r.customer_id = ${customers.id})`,
)).limit(50)   // hard cap per run — drains a backlog over weeks rather than nuking 1k accounts in one tick
```

Per-row sequence:

1. **Audit-first**:
   ```ts
   logEvent({
     name: 'onboarding_account_pruned',
     customerId: null,        // important — see below
     userId,
     properties: { email, founderName, customerId, daysOld },
   })
   ```
   `customerId: null` so the audit row survives the cascade. The customer's
   UUID lives in `properties` for forensics. `userId` survives via
   `onDelete: 'set null'` on `wb_events.userId` (line 128 of schema).
2. `DELETE FROM wb_users WHERE id = ?` — cascades to:
   - `wb_customers` (line 16)
   - `wb_legal_acceptances` (line 102)
   - `wb_password_reset_tokens` (line 140)
   - `wb_events.customerId` rows (line 127) — fine, our prune event was
     written with `customerId: null`

Errors caught per-row.

## Email template

`src/winback/lib/email.ts`, appended after `sendPasswordResetEmail`. Same
shape: plain text, no DNC/AI-pause/footer machinery, **no unsubscribe
link**. This is a one-shot transactional message to a verified founder
who actively created an account; CAN-SPAM and UK GDPR carve out
relationship messages, and `sendPasswordResetEmail` is the established
precedent. The body's *"ignore this email and we won't send another"* +
the 90-day auto-prune commitment is the soft opt-out.

```ts
export async function sendOnboardingNudgeEmail(opts: {
  to: string
  founderName: string | null
}): Promise<void>
```

Subject: `Still want to set up Winback?`

Body:
```
Hi {founderName ?? 'there'},

You signed up a few days ago but haven't connected Stripe yet — that's the
only step left:

{NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/onboarding/stripe

Takes about 90 seconds. If something's blocking you, hit reply. If it's not
the right fit, you can ignore this — we'll clean up the unused account in 90 days.

— Winback
```

From: `Winback <support@winbackflow.co>` (monitored inbox — the body invites
replies). Wrap in `callWithRetry` for 429 handling.

### Day-83 deletion-warning email

```ts
export async function sendDormantAccountDeletionWarningEmail(opts: {
  to: string
  founderName: string | null
}): Promise<void>
```

Subject: `Your Winback account will be deleted in 7 days`

Body:
```
Hi {founderName ?? 'there'},

You signed up ~12 weeks ago but never connected Stripe. We'll delete the
unused account in 7 days.

To keep it, connect Stripe (~90 seconds):
{NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/onboarding/stripe

If you'd rather we delete it, ignore this — no further messages. Questions? Hit reply.

— Winback
```

Same `from: Winback <support@winbackflow.co>`, same retry wrapper. No
unsubscribe link — it's a transactional account-lifecycle notice.

---

## Admin filter

[app/api/admin/customers/route.ts](../app/api/admin/customers/route.ts):

- Read `searchParams.get('filter')`.
- If `filter === 'stuck_on_signup'`, push
  `` sql`${customers.stripeAccountId} IS NULL` `` into the existing
  `filters: []` array.
- The route currently does `where(filters[0])` — fix to
  `where(and(...filters))` so `q=` and `filter=` stack.

[app/admin/customers/customers-client.tsx](../app/admin/customers/customers-client.tsx):

- New `useState<'all' | 'stuck_on_signup'>('all')` filter.
- Two-button toggle row above the search input: "All" / "Stuck on signup".
- Append `&filter=stuck_on_signup` to the fetch URL when set.
- Add a "Days since signup" column derived from `r.createdAt` so the
  filtered view is actionable for manual outreach.

---

## `register_completed` event

[app/api/auth/register/route.ts](../app/api/auth/register/route.ts) — after
the `legalAcceptances` insert, before the `NextResponse.json({ success: true })`:

```ts
await logEvent({
  name: 'register_completed',
  userId: newUser.id,
  properties: { hasName: !!name },
})
```

`logEvent` swallows errors so this can never 500 the registration.

This makes the founder funnel reconstructable end-to-end:

```
register_completed → onboarding_stripe_viewed → oauth_completed
                         ↓ (drop-off)              ↓ (drop-off)
                  onboarding_nudge_sent      onboarding_account_pruned
```

## Tests

Pattern: heavy `vi.hoisted` mocks of `@/lib/db`, `@/lib/schema`,
`drizzle-orm`. Mirrors
[billing-notifications.test.ts](../src/winback/__tests__/billing-notifications.test.ts)
and the password-reset route tests from Spec 29.

`src/winback/__tests__/onboarding-followup-emails.test.ts` (8 tests covering both):
- Nudge: subject contains "set up Winback"
- Nudge: body includes `${NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/onboarding/stripe`
- Nudge: null `founderName` → "Hi there"
- Nudge: Resend error throws
- Warning: subject contains "deleted in 7 days"
- Warning: body includes `${NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/onboarding/stripe`
- Warning: null `founderName` → "Hi there"
- Both: skip silently when `RESEND_API_KEY` unset

`src/winback/__tests__/onboarding-followup-cron.test.ts` (~15 tests):
- Nudge: skips when `stripeAccountId` set
- Nudge: skips when already nudged (`onboardingNudgeSentAt` not null)
- Nudge: skips users < 3 days old
- Nudge: skips `users.isAdmin = true`
- Nudge: writes `onboarding_nudge_sent_at` after successful send
- Nudge: continues when one row's send throws
- Warning: skips when < 83 days old
- Warning: skips when already warned (`deletionWarningSentAt` not null)
- Warning: skips when ≥ 90 days (prune handles those)
- Warning: writes `deletion_warning_sent_at` after send
- Prune: skips < 90 days
- Prune: skips when `stripeAccountId` set
- Prune: respects `dryRun`
- Prune: caps at 50 rows
- Prune: writes audit event with `customerId: null` BEFORE delete

`src/winback/__tests__/admin-customers-filter.test.ts` (3 tests):
- `filter=stuck_on_signup` adds the IS NULL clause
- `filter=stuck_on_signup` + `q=foo` stacks
- Unknown filter is ignored

Update `src/winback/__tests__/events.test.ts` if it whitelists names — add
`register_completed`, `onboarding_nudge_sent`,
`onboarding_deletion_warning_sent`, `onboarding_account_pruned`.

## Verification before merge

Per CLAUDE.md:

- [ ] `npx tsc --noEmit` — clean
- [ ] `npx vitest run` — all green
- [ ] Migration 025 applied to Neon (show SQL, wait for "yes")
- [ ] **First prod cron run uses `?dryRun=1`** — review the eligible-prune
      list before allowing a real delete
- [ ] Local cron click-through:
  ```bash
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" \
    'http://localhost:3000/api/cron/onboarding-followup?dryRun=1'
  # backdate a test customer's created_at, then real run:
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" \
    'http://localhost:3000/api/cron/onboarding-followup'
  ```
- [ ] Manual UI walk-through:
  - Register fresh test account → `wb_events` has `register_completed`
  - Backdate customer to 4 days ago → run cron → Resend dashboard shows
    the nudge email + `onboarding_nudge_sent_at` is set + `wb_events` has
    `onboarding_nudge_sent`
  - Backdate to 84 days → run cron → warning email arrives +
    `deletion_warning_sent_at` set + `wb_events` has
    `onboarding_deletion_warning_sent`
  - Visit `/admin/customers?filter=stuck_on_signup` → only the test row
  - Backdate to 91 days, real run → cascade delete confirmed
    (`SELECT * FROM wb_users WHERE id = '<test-id>'` returns 0 rows;
    legal-acceptances, password-reset-tokens also gone; `wb_events` has
    the audit row with `customerId: null`)
- [ ] PR opened with explicit migration callout
- [ ] Human says "merge"

## Edge cases handled

1. **Race: Stripe connected between cron tick and send** — re-check
   `stripeAccountId IS NULL` in the per-row loop right before sending.
2. **Internal accounts** (e.g. `tejaasvi@gmail.com`,
   `support@winbackflow.co`) — excluded via `users.is_admin = false` in
   both passes. Column already exists from Spec 25.
3. **Bounced typo'd emails** — Resend marks undeliverable; auto-prune at
   90 days resolves it. No special handling.
4. **Crash mid-batch** — per-row try/catch with continue. Send-then-update
   means a transient Resend failure could re-send tomorrow; one duplicate
   nudge in N years is acceptable.
5. **Recoveries on a non-Stripe customer** — impossible by data flow
   (recoveries come from connected-Stripe webhooks), but the
   `NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM wb_recoveries WHERE customer_id = ?)` guard
   makes the prune safe even if the invariant is ever broken.
6. **First prod run sweeps pre-existing dormant accounts** — first run
   must be `?dryRun=1` so the human can audit the prune list before
   enabling real deletes.

---

## Out of scope (future)

- Spec 11 GDPR — once shipped, the prune logic here should defer to the
  retention-policy table rather than hard-coding 90 days.
- "Reactivate within 30 days" UX — letting a deleted founder restore
  their old account by clicking a link in their inbox. Acceptable
  alternative is just re-registering.
- A/B testing nudge subject lines.
