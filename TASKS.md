# TASKS — Winback Build Sequence

Work through in order. Check off each item. Do not skip ahead.
Read the corresponding spec file before starting each phase.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation
**Spec: specs/01-database-auth.md**

### Task 1.1 — Audit existing project
- [ ] Run `ls -la` and show full file tree
- [ ] Read `package.json` — list every installed package
- [ ] Read `tsconfig.json` — note path aliases (e.g. `@/`)
- [ ] Check if `components/ui` exists (shadcn already initialised?)
- [ ] List any existing pages in `app/`

⛔ **STOP — report all findings to human before writing any code**

### Task 1.2 — Install packages
Show human this full list before installing:
```
drizzle-orm              ORM core
@neondatabase/serverless  Neon Postgres driver
drizzle-kit              Migration CLI (devDependency)
next-auth@beta           Auth
@auth/drizzle-adapter    NextAuth Drizzle adapter
bcryptjs                 Password hashing
@types/bcryptjs
stripe                   Stripe SDK
@anthropic-ai/sdk        Claude API
resend                   Transactional email
zod                      Validation
swr                      Data fetching
@types/node
vitest                   Tests (devDependency)
@vitejs/plugin-react     (devDependency)
```
⛔ **STOP — wait for human approval before running `npm install`**

### Task 1.3 — Environment setup
Create `env.example` (NOT `.env.local`). Output this to human:
```
Add a Neon database:
  Go to vercel.com → your project → Storage tab → Create Database → Neon
  Then run: vercel env pull .env.local
  This sets DATABASE_URL automatically.

Also add to .env.local:
  NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<run: openssl rand -base64 32>
  NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
  ENCRYPTION_KEY=<run: openssl rand -hex 16>
  CRON_SECRET=<any random string>

Tell me when .env.local has DATABASE_URL set.
```

### Task 3.2 — Step 2: Changelog
- [ ] Create `app/onboarding/changelog/page.tsx`

### Task 3.3 — Step 3: Review email
- [ ] Create `app/onboarding/review/page.tsx`
- [ ] "Approve & enter dashboard →" sets `onboarding_complete = true` + redirects to `/dashboard`

---

## Phase 4 — Core engine
**Spec: specs/04-core-engine.md**

### Task 4.1 — Encryption
- [ ] Create `src/winback/lib/encryption.ts`

### Task 8.2 — Route protection audit
- [ ] `/dashboard` and `/onboarding/*` → redirect to `/login` if no session

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets anywhere

---

## Phase 9 — Billing (NOT IMPLEMENTED — blocker for charging customers)

**Status (2026-04-15):** Pricing is 15% of recovered revenue × 12 months per subscriber.
`src/winback/lib/billing.ts::calculateMonthlyFee` returns the right number and is tested.
`/api/billing/preview` exposes it. **Nothing else exists.** No card capture, no invoice
creation, no cron, no dunning. Landing/settings/onboarding copy promises all of this —
must be built before taking paid customers.

### Task 9.1 — Deferred card capture (Stripe SetupIntent)
- [ ] On first successful recovery event: trigger a Stripe SetupIntent for the Winback
      customer, store the resulting PaymentMethod against `users` (or a new
      `billing_customers` row). Webhook-driven, idempotent.
- [ ] New page `/settings/billing/add-card` — Stripe Elements flow that completes the
      SetupIntent client-side and returns to dashboard.
- [ ] Dashboard banner state when `recoveries > 0 && !paymentMethodId` — block further
      recoveries or flag prominently (decide before build).

### Task 9.2 — Monthly invoice run (Vercel cron)
- [ ] Vercel cron: 1st of each month, iterates all customers with `paymentMethodId`.
- [ ] For each: `calculateMonthlyFee(customerId)` → create a Stripe invoice on the
      Winback platform account (not the connected customer's Stripe) with a single line
      item "Winback — {month} recovered revenue fee" at `totalFeeCents`.
- [ ] Auto-advance + auto-charge the saved payment method.
- [ ] Idempotency: store `billing_runs(customerId, yearMonth)` unique key so a retried
      cron never double-charges.

### Task 9.3 — Dunning for Winback's own fees
- [ ] Listen to `invoice.payment_failed` on the **platform** account webhook (distinct
      from the existing connected-account webhook).
- [ ] Retry schedule + email sequence (reuse `scripts/test-dunning.ts` shape).
- [ ] After N failures: suspend the Winback account (no new recoveries sent until
      paid).

### Task 9.4 — Billing visibility in-app
- [ ] Settings → Billing: wire to `/api/billing/preview` so the customer sees their
      current month's running fee, attributed subscribers, and £/month each.
- [ ] Invoice history list (pulls from Stripe).

### Task 9.5 — Stripe platform approval
- [ ] Before launching this — Stripe must approve the platform account to charge its
      own customers. Track in the Stripe dashboard application.
- [ ] Terms + privacy + DPA pages already live (shipped in Tier 1 GDPR).

⛔ **STOP — final human review before declaring done**

---

## Phase 10 — Trust & control (shipped + roadmap)

### Task 10.1 — FAQ page ✅
- [x] `/faq` with 18 Q&As across Stripe access, email behaviour, pricing, reliability.
- [x] Linked from landing nav + landing/pricing footers.
- [x] No trade-secret disclosure (no model names, no algorithm hints).

### Task 10.2 — Pause toggle ✅
- [x] `customers.paused_at` column (migration `006_pause.sql`).
- [x] `POST /api/settings/pause` — auth-gated, sets/clears `paused_at`.
- [x] Settings UI toggle with confirm dialog.
- [x] `scheduleExitEmail` short-circuits when the customer is paused
      (`isCustomerPausedForSubscriber`).
- [x] Tests in `email.test.ts` cover paused + unpaused paths.

### Task 10.3 — Danger zone + delete workspace ✅
**Spec: specs/11-danger-zone.md**
- [x] Rose-styled Danger Zone card at the bottom of /settings with Pause + Delete rows.
- [x] `/settings/delete` consequence screen with real numbers (subscribers,
      recoveries, £ recovered) + one-time "pause instead" CTA.
- [x] Gate 2: typed workspace-name confirmation (case-insensitive, trimmed).
- [x] Gate 3: 3-second real countdown before the API call fires.
- [x] `POST /api/settings/delete` — revalidates confirmation server-side,
      explicitly deletes `wb_recoveries` (no FK cascade), then deletes the user
      row — cascade handles customers → churned_subscribers → emails_sent +
      legal_acceptances.
- [x] Client signs out via `next-auth/react` on success.
- [x] Unit tests for `slugifyWorkspaceName` + `confirmationMatches`.

### Task 10.4 — Read-only Stripe via API key (roadmap)
- [ ] Alternative to OAuth `read_write`: accept a customer-issued restricted key with
      read-only subscription/customer scopes.
- [ ] Disables one-click reactivation (requires write) — surface this trade-off in UI.
- [ ] Promised in FAQ as "email us for early access" — no code yet.

### Task 10.5 — Open-obligation guard on delete (must-ship before first paid customer)
**Spec: specs/11-danger-zone.md — Addendum**
- [ ] `src/winback/lib/obligations.ts` — `computeOpenObligationCents()` over live,
      in-window recoveries with the 12-month clamp.
- [ ] Gate-0 on `/settings/delete`: render Settlement-required block when
      obligations > 0; lock Gates 1–3.
- [ ] `POST /api/settings/request-settlement` + `wb_settlement_requests` table
      (migration `007_settlement_requests.sql`) + email to `ops@`.
- [ ] Re-check obligations server-side in `POST /api/settings/delete`, return
      HTTP 409 when owed — don't trust the client.
- [ ] Copy updates on `/privacy` (billing records retained under legal
      obligation) and `/terms` §3 (deletion does not waive attribution).
- [ ] Unit tests for `computeOpenObligationCents` + integration test for 409.

### Task 10.6 — Soft-close target (blocked on Phase 9.1)
- [ ] Once platform-side SetupIntent capture (9.1) lands, replace the hard
      "Delete workspace" with "Close workspace": tokens + operational data
      wiped, billing ledger + customer row retained with `closed_at`, cron
      (9.2) continues charging the saved PaymentMethod until every
      `attribution_ends_at` passes. Supersedes 10.5 settlement-request flow.

### Task 10.7 — Stripe-side deauthorize on delete (roadmap)
- [ ] Call Stripe OAuth `/oauth/deauthorize` during workspace deletion so the
      customer doesn't need to revoke from Stripe → Apps separately. Skipped for
      now because a failed deauth shouldn't block the user-side delete.
